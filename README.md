# ComplexNumber
Project contains an implementation of a Rust structure representing a complex number.

## Current functionalities:
* calculating modulus and argument of a number,
* logical operators '==' and '!=',
* arithmetic operators '+', '-', '*' and '/' for two complex numbers,
* '+' operator for complex number and 64 bit float (implementation for other operators similar so I will skip it).

## TODO:
* '!' (or other) operator for conjugation of a given number,
* generic type instead of float,
* getting input from a user,
* reading complex data
